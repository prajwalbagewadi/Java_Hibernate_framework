Hibernate notes

Hibernate is a popular Java framework designed to simplify the development of applications that interact with databases. 
1. It is an open-source, lightweight ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that implements the Java Persistence API (JPA),
2. allowing developers to map Java objects to database tables seamlessly.

1. What is ORM?
	An ORM tool bridges the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases. It maps Java objects to relational 	database tables, enabling easy data manipulation, creation, and access.

	How does Hibernate fit in?
		Hibernate automatically maps Java classes to database tables, allowing developers to work with objects rather than SQL.

2. JPA (Java Persistence API)
Definition: JPA is a Java specification that provides a set of standards for ORM tools, allowing them to persist data.
Why is JPA important?
JPA ensures that Hibernate follows a consistent structure and provides common interfaces for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a database.

### Copy Format for Advantages of Hibernate Framework

**Open Source and Lightweight**  
- Hibernate is freely available under the LGPL license.  
- It’s lightweight, meaning it consumes minimal system resources.  

---

**Fast Performance**  
- Hibernate uses a cache mechanism (First-level and Second-level cache) to enhance performance.  
- First-level cache is enabled by default, reducing database access by storing frequently accessed data.  

---

**Database Independent Query**  
- Hibernate Query Language (HQL) abstracts SQL queries and allows developers to write object-oriented queries.  
- This leads to reduced maintenance as there’s no need to update queries if the underlying database changes.  

---

**Automatic Table Creation**  
- Hibernate automatically creates database tables for the mapped entities, eliminating the need to manually create tables.  

---

**Simplifies Complex Joins**  
- Fetching data from multiple tables is simplified using Hibernate's powerful querying capabilities.  

---

**Provides Query Statistics and Database Status**  
- Hibernate supports query cache and provides statistics on query performance and database status.
